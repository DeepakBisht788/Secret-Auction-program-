# Bidding Program
This Python program allows multiple users to place bids. The program displays an ASCII art logo and then prompts users to input their names and bids. It keeps track of all bids and, once all bidders are done, it announces the winner with the highest bid.

## Features
- **Interactive Bidding**: Users can input their names and bid amounts.
- **Real-Time Updates**: After each bid, the program asks if there are other bidders.
- **Winner Announcement**: Once all bids are in, the program announces the highest bid and the corresponding bidder.
- **ASCII Art**: Displays a cool logo before starting the bidding process.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
3. Enter your name and bid when prompted.
4. After each bid, the program will ask if there are any more bidders.
   - Type **"yes"** if there are more bidders.
   - Type **"no"** if no one else is bidding.
5. Once all bids are in, the program will announce the highest bidder.
